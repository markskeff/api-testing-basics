# Exercise Instructions

In this practical exercise, you will use an online API testing tool (Postman) to perform request-response actions on a sample API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com). The goal is to familiarize yourself with the tool's interface and understand how different HTTP methods and requests impact API responses.

## Getting Started

1. Open a web browser on your computer.
2. Go to [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) and sign up or log in to your Postman account.
3. Once logged in, you will be greeted with the Postman dashboard.

## Importing Requests

1. From the dashboard, click on the "New" button at the top-left corner.
2. Choose "Collection" to create a new collection for your API requests.
3. Give your collection a name (e.g., "API Testing Basics Collection").
4. Click "Create" to create the collection.
5. Within your collection, click the "Import" button.
6. Choose "Link" and provide the URL to the collection JSON file provided in the repository's `api_test_scripts/` directory.

## Running API Requests

1. Click on a specific request from your collection to select it.
2. Review the request details, including the HTTP method, URL, headers, and parameters.
3. Click the "Send" button to execute the request.
4. Examine the response you receive, paying attention to the status code, headers, and response content.

## Exploring Responses

1. After sending the API requests, carefully review the responses you receive.
2. Pay close attention to the status codes to understand the outcome of each request.
3. Examine the headers to understand the context of the response.
4. Explore the response content, which may include JSON data.

## Modifying Requests (Optional)

1. If you're comfortable, you can experiment by modifying the requests.
2. Change parameters, headers, or request bodies to observe how responses change.
3. This experimentation will deepen your understanding of API interactions.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully completed the practical exercise using an online API testing tool. By sending requests and interpreting responses, you've gained valuable experience in API testing concepts and techniques. Remember to continue practicing and exploring different scenarios to enhance your skills further.

Enjoy your journey into the world of API testing!
